# How to contribute

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we are able to process requests as efficiently as possible. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact us at [opensource@nike.com](mailto:opensource@nike.com).

## Getting Started

* Review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/nike-inc.github.io/blob/master/CONDUCT.md)
* Submit the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/Nike-Inc/nike-inc.github.io)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch off of `master` before you start your work.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the Nike-Inc organization.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
* Bug fixes or features that lack appropriate tests may not be considered for merge.
* Changes that lower test coverage may not be considered for merge.
