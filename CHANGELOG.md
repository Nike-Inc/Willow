  - Added by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).

#### Updated

- The Xcode project and source code to Swift 4.0.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).
- The log level enabled check to run prior to acquiring the lock or async dispatch queue resulting in a small performance gain.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request

- The example frameworks to not have a default logger instance.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).
- The example app configuration logic to match the new APIs.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).
- The `LogMessageWriter` protocol by splitting it into two new protocols: `LogWriter` and `LogModifierWriter`.
The former is a basic writer.
The latter is a writer that also accepts an array of modifiers to apply to incoming messages.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).
- Example frameworks to show intended usage of the new `LogMessage` APIs.
  - Updated by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).

#### Removed

- `LoggerConfiguration` entirely. `Logger` construction now takes a log level, writers array, and execution method which greatly simplifies setup and usage.
  - Removed by [Dave Camp](https://github.com/atomiccat) in Pull Request
  [#28](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow/pull/28).
